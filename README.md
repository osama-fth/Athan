Athan

Athan is a simple HTML page that shows Islamic prayer times for a selected city. 
I utilized the Aladhan API to fetch the prayer times and the Calendar API to convert the Gregorian date to the Hijri date. 
This project serves as my first small venture into web development, integrating APIs to deliver dynamic content.
The page allows users to see the daily prayer times based on their chosen city, while also providing the corresponding Hijri date.
